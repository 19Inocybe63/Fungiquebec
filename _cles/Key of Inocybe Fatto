  The following key was created using a framework provided by the Field Studies Council which in their words "is a set of tools for creating and publishing interactive web-based identification resources, including multi-access keys".

  Because this genera needs microscopic information to identify the species, the key is not really of use to the total beginner, but can be of assistance to the intermediate and expert mycologists when studying Inocybe.

  By inputting various characteristics it should allow for relatively easy identification of many species in this group and where there is uncertainty, they should give enough information to allow further study to identify some of the more difficult species.
