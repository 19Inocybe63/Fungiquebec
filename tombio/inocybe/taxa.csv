The lack of pruinosity at the apex of the stipe is usually stressed, and is a marked feature of the Nova Scotian specimens. It appears, however, that there may be some discrepancies between the first and the more recent accounts of the species. In the original diagnosis, Karsten describes the apex of the stipe as pruinose (""i toppen hvitpudrad""), and gives the size of the spores as 10-13 x 5-7 micron. Massee, who apparently examined part of the type (Massee, G. 1904. A monograph of the genus Inocybne. Karsten. Ann. Bot. 18 : 459-504; p. 480), states that the spores are 10-14 x 5-7 micron. If these measurements are correct and Karsten's description of the apex of the stipe as pruinose is accurate, the current concept of I. abjecta may have to be reconsidered.","Grund, D.W.; Stuntz, D.E.

We cannot concur in the opinion of some European mycologists, that I. acuta and I. umboninota Peck are synonymous. They are similar in appearance, but have different types of spores. This is the first record of I. acuta for North America.","Grund, D.W.; Stuntz, D.E. Nova Scotian Inocybes IV., Mycologia, vol. 69, 1977; p. 394-395","To be characterised shortly within the section Inocybe, I. acuta has a dark appearance with prominent umbo, stipe with whitish bulb at base, and rather dark spores. The identity of Inocybe acuta has been constantly misunderstood since Kuehner and Boursier (1932) regarded it as a variable species of montane spruce forests. The confusion, involving, for example, the wrong habitat (""bei Nadelbaeumen, auf kalkhaltigen Boden""), can be found in literature such as the key provided by Stangl and Enderle (1983). And still, recently, Breitenbach and Kraenzlin (2000) synonymised I. striata with I. acuta. Boudier saved a type specimen, remarked on its growth among Sphagnum, and described this species well. One reason for the misunderstandings has probably been that Salix thickets have largely been ignored as collection sites. Also, Lange (1917) regarded I. acuta as synonymous with I. umboninota Peck. Adding to the confusion, Bon (1976) described I. acutella, a species resembling I. acuta and growing in Sphagnum near Salix and Alnus. He stated that I. acutella differs from I. acuta (and the separate I. umboninota) in spores and habitat, but did not state whether he had studied the type of I. acuta (Bon 1976, 1979). Romagnesi (1989) did study the type of I. acuta and regarded it as a synonym of I.  cutella; a conclusion we share. In microscopic features, the type of I. acuta clearly coincided with our collections from Salix thickets and with Bon's detailed descriptions of I. acutella. The macroscopic features also matched. Peck (1884) offered a scanty description of Inocybe umboninota from the United States, but fortunately saved a type. Esteve-Raventos (1987) found the spores of Peck's type to be star-shaped, and thus clearly deviating from the spores of I. acuta Boud., judging from his photographs. Kauffman (1924) described I. prominens from one of Peck's collections of I. umboninota. The microscopic features of I. prominens do not fit I. acuta either : the spores are smaller, 6-8 X 4-6 microns, sometimes irregularly subglobose, and the cystidia have thin walls (Kauffman 1924).","Kokkonen, Katri; Vauras, Jukka. Eleven new boreal species of Inocybe with nodulose spores, Mycol Progress (2012) 11:299-341; p. 304-306","The description given by Kokkonen and Vauras differs somewhat from that of Grund and Stuntz.

Sometimes they share a site. However, the distribution of I. acutoides is concentrated in the northern boreal zone, whereas I. acuta has a wide distribution from France to the alpine zone of northern Fennoscandia. The most distinct microscopic differences from I. acuta are paler spores and frequent thin-walled cheilocystidia. These two species show clear divergence in their ITS; there were 98 base pair differences and 17 insertions/deletions (1-19 bases in length) between I. acuta and the holotype of I. acutoides. Inocybe borealis is close to I. acutoides in both microscopic features and in ITS. The holotypes differed only in 11 bases and 3 insertions/deletions (1-3 bases in length). Though I. borealis might grow in shore forests, it is not associated with Salix according to our observations. In addition, it looks somewhat different from I. acutoides; the pileus, for example, often has a yellow tinge. The most useful microscopic difference from I. acutoides seems to be the numerous thick-walled caulocystidia. Inocybe lapponica can be confused with I. acutoides in the northern boreal zone. These fungi resemble each other in both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics. However, the spores of I. lapponica usually lack prominent apical nodules and are more rarely elongated. I. lapponica also grows on shores, but is not restricted to Salix.","Kokkonen, Katri; Vauras, Jukka.

Inocybe bakeri is a relatively robust species that is characterized mainly by its large basidiospores, and Peck's protolog describes the stipe as ""more or less radicating"". The caulocystidiate nature of the stipe surface appears to be variable. In her key to species of Inocybe from California Nishida (1989) places I. bakeri in two different places, once in subsection ""Holoconiatae"" and another time in subsection ""Acroconiatae"" reflecting the variation in this character. Our examination of the holotype for the species indicated that no caulocystidia are present on the lower half of the stipe although a few caulocystidiate hairs were present at the middle of the stipe. Yet the second specimen (ST-02-077-01) studied had scarce but distinct caulocystidia present at the base of the stipe.

Our identifications of boreal collections, a subarctic collection, and I. heterochrominea are primarily based on ITS and LSU sequences, because the spores diverged so much from the I. borealis type. They were consistently smaller (except in KK141/03), paler, and more strongly nodulose. The Nordic ITS sequences were identical with the type sequence of I. borealis in two specimens (KK190/08 - GenBank JN580813, KK&JV27051F - JN580814), or deviated from the type by one gap (JV9244 - JN580815), by one common base in nine specimens (KK&JV26120F - JN580816), by one other base in JV15250F (JN580817), by one base and a gap of 12 bases (KK141/03 - JN580818), or by two bases (Heinonen 307-95 - JN580819). The I. heterochrominea type deviated from the I. borealis type by one base and a gap of one base, when 42 bases were lacking in the middle of the I. heterochrominea sequence and three loci with ambiguous bases were ignored. The LSU sequences of the type of I. borealis and a collection with one different base in ITS (KK&JV26120F - JN580889) diverged by one base as well. An arctic collection from Svalbard (Online Resource Fig. S3) resembled the Greenland type in its spores, the presence of velipellis (absent in the other collections), and identical ITS (in the phylogram, JN580820). These specimens thus seem to form their own group. They both also have dark brown pilei seemingly unlike most boreal collections (the colours may have changed in exsiccata). Still, the two boreal collections with the type ITS also have dark brown pilei (Online Resource Fig. S2), but in spores they resemble other boreal specimens rather than the type; thus forming an intermediate group. Overall, the strength of nodularity varies rather much among the boreal specimens, and rarely the spores are elongated (KK141/03) as in the type of Inocybe borealis. We were unable to find more distinct morphological boundaries between the specimens differing in ITS or between arctic and boreal/subarctic collections, and thus we tentatively determine them all to be the same very variable species. The observed morphological differences may have been caused by environment, or may be genetically intraspecific. The amount of velipellis, for example, often varies within species and seems to increase in arctic and alpine environments. The microscopic and macroscopic features of Inocybe heterochrominea agreed with our Nordic collections of I. borealis. Accordingly, we have reduced it to a synonym. The walls of the cystidia of the I. heterochrominea holotype (a piece of a pileus) seemed thinner than in the drawings of Grund and Stuntz (1983), and the spores did not seem quite as strongly nodulose. I. heterochrominea was described from mixed and conifer forests of Michigan, Nova Scotia, and Washington. In Finland, I. borealis grows in various habitats, and we assume Betula to be one host. Lange (1957) did not mention any plant species from the type site, but he described the vegetation and fungi of the northern slopes, for example, stating that Betula nana was the dominant shrub and Salix glauca was scattered.

It was described from Northern Spain (Fernandez Sasia 2004), but was reported already earlier from Germany and the Netherlands under the names I. mixtiloides and I. mixtilioides (Krieglsteiner 1989). This species is about the same size as I. caprimulgi, and both species can also become blackish when dried. It has a pileus with ochre-yellow colour, at centre ochre-brown, being more yellow than I. caprimulgi. However, the yellow colour can disappear in dry weather. Comparing the microscopical characters, the spores are quite similar, but on average slightly larger in I. krieglsteineri. There are more dissimilarities in the cystidia. I. caprimulgi is characterized by having cystidia that are somewhat broader, and very often with a rounded base. I. krieglsteineri has on average longer and narrower lageniform pleurocystidia and longer caulocystidia. Ecologically, I. krieglsteineri seems to grow mainly with Quercus (Krieglsteiner 1989), but Esteve-Raventos et al. (2015) mention also collections with Pinus pinea, P. pinaster and Castanea sativa. We have seen collections of the species from France, Germany, Slovakia, Slovenia and from the coast of Southern Sweden, where it seems to grow on calcareous sandy soil near Quercus robur and Corylus avellana. Stangl (1989: 282-283, Plate 35.4) describes an Inocybe sp., collected in Bayern near Betula, Pinus and Picea abies.

Heim (Genre Inocybe : 195. 1931) comes very close but differs in possessing an equal stipe without marginate bulb. The colour of the pileus was described as dark ochraceous. It seems possible that such collections indicate that both varieties recognised above cannot be separated unambiguously. As I have not seen specimens conforming to Heim's protologue, I refrain from giving a definite opinion on this taxon. 1) Althrough type-material of both I. cookei and I. fastigiata var microsperma is lacking, I consider  these names as mere synonyms, as I have not been able to discern any important discrepancies in their protologues. 2) As already noted on p. 5, pileal shape is phenotypically very variable ; specimens growing on sunny places have a rather rigid velipellis which persists in older specimens, and lack an umbo, whereas other specimens, apparently from the same mycelium and growing in shade, are distinctly umbonate and do not possess a velipellis in older specimens. This should be a warning against overrating the importance of velar characters as specific criterion.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.

However, my observation failed to confirm their results as both characters were found to be far more variable and without correlation. For that reason their taxonomy of this complex is not accepted here. In a previous publication (in Persoonia 12 : 385. 1985) I considered I. dentifera to represent an autonomous species. However, after the completion of the manuscript, more material came to my attention, and these additional collections showed that the appendiculate-dentate pileal margin was overrated as a taxonomic criterion. For that reason I now reduce I. dentifera in the synonymy of I. flocculosa. 2) Slender forms with yellowish tinges in the pileus often resemble I. auricoma (Batsch) J. Lange, but can be separated on account of their somewhat larger, distinctly lageniform pleurocystidia. The pileus of I. flocculosa is somewhat more squamulose too. 3) A variant with a well-developed velipellis has been described under the misapplied name I. abjecta (P. Karst.) Sacc., e.g. by Lange (Fl. Agar. Dan. 3 : 73. 1938) and Kuehner (in Bull. Soc. Nat. Oyonnax 9 (Suppl.) : 79. 1955). Such variants also possess somewhat smaller spores and cystidia than typical var. flocculosa. As some overlap in the critical characters can be observed, such variants are not given independent status for the time being. However, more material might indicate that they are better recognised as an autonomous form.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.

Kumm. a nomen dubium. For that reason a new name was needed. The oldest available is based on Agaricus fraudans Britz., a name also neotypified by me (see above). 2) Most mycologists have been inclined to recognise two different species based on differences in habit and pileal covering. The same I. pyriodora was used for the smaller taxon with a somewhat appressedly scaly pileus, whereas the name I. incarnata was used for the robust species with a smooth, even somewhat greasy pileus. However, I came to the conclusion that this character difference is at least partly phenotypically determined. Moreover, too many intermediates were encountered (even in collections found at the same locality in different years) to allow for taxonomic separation of these variants. 3)  Variants without or with only a faint smell show less distinct reddening of the contest.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.

The variant most commonly encountered in western Europe is characterised by a slender habit, dark brown pileus and a relatively long stipe. It often grows under frondose trees on rather damp soil. This variant is well illustrated by Heim and Lange as I. descissa var. brunneoatra. In central Europe a more robust variant is encountered with a stouter habit, a somewhat to distinctly paler pileus (depending on the development of the velipellis) and relatively short and firm stipe. It grows mostly under conifers but can also be encountered under frondose trees. The illustration by Bresadola (sub nom. I. rimosa) is characteristic for this variant. Although the extremes of these variants are macroscopically strikingly different, they hardly differ in microscopical characters. Intermediates between the extremes are repeatedly encountered, and for that reason no formal status has been given to those variants. The conspecificity of I. virgatula and I. hypophaea has also been confirmed by Kuehner (in Bull. Soc. Nat. Oyonnax 9 (Suppl.) : 59-63. 1955) and Furrer-Ziogas (pers. Comm.). The sole difference between both variants is to be found in the development of the velipellis, resulting in either a distinctly umbonate, brown rimulose pileus, or a sordid isabella-brown pileus without umbo. Intermediates are not seldomly encountered, even within a group that seems to originate from one mycelium. 2) Inocybe pseudodestricta is closely related to I. fuscidula, but differs in having a rather shiny, brown pileus often mixed with reddish tinges, yellowish lamellae and a stipe with pinkish tinges. Inocybe nitidiuscula differs in having reddish tinges at the apex of the stipe and somewhat larger spores.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.

In young carpophores with unexpanded pilei the pileal cuticle is continuous with a similar layer that sheathes the basal portion of the stipe and like the pileal surface is subviscid when wet. When the pileus expands this enveloping layer ruptures at the pileal margin and collapses on the stipe in an annular zone of subviscid streaks or patches. In these particulars as well as in the size and type of spore, and nature of the pleurocystidia, Inocybe fuscodisca resembles I. geophylla (Sow. Ex Fr.) Kummer, and we are inclined to think it is closely related to the latter species. This appears to be the first report of I. fuscodisca from Nova Scotia, but the species is widely distributed in North America, having been found in New York, Tennessee, Michigan, California and Washington.","Grund, D.W.; Stuntz, D.E.

It could be an odourless form of either I. cervicolor (Pers.) Quel. or I. geraniodora J. Favre. 2) Inocybe geraniodora seems to come close to I. mutata (Peck) Mass. in Ann. Bot. 18 : 496 (1904), based on Agaricus mutatus Peck in Ann. Rep. N. Y. State Mus. 24 : 69 (1872). According to the description this latter species is more robust and lacks a distinctive smell. I did not examine the type, but studied another collection from the Unites States (Michigan, Cheboygan County, Rucis Bog between Burt Lake and Douglas Lake, 30VI.1963, Bas. 3186). Further investigation might show these taxa to be conspecific.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.

All the ITS1 sequences were identical with the I. giacomi type sequence except for an insertion of two bases in I. striaepes, an end shortage in I. hinnulea, and a locus where I. giacomi had A, I. johannae had an ambiguous base A or T, and the others had T. The ITS2 sequences of types other than I. hinnulea failed. ITS2 sequences differed from each other by one or two bases at the most (the Nordic specimens - GenBank JN580868, JN580869, JN580870, JN580872, in the phylogram Holtan & Larsen 28-2008 - JN580871). A Finnish specimen collected from a park (KK370/03) deviated from the others in appearance having a large, weakly fibrillose, pale yellow brown pileus, and frequent utriform cystidia. For these reasons, we hesitated to identify it as I. giacomi and excluded it from the description. The macroscopic and microscopic features of the other collections matched. Ferrari (2006) considered I. johannae a synonym of I. giacomi based on morphology. He also reported a collection from a subalpine locality. Further, Roedel and Vesper (2009) found I. giacomi from elsewhere than mountains, in a German hilly region. The identification of Inocybe giacomi has been to some extent problematic. Favre (1955) did not have any type, but he renamed his collections of I. carpta Scop. sensu Bresadola as I. giacomi. Stangl (1976) chose a holotype (this should have been a lectotype), which Horak (1987) rejected in favour of a new lectotype (Favre 124a), corresponding to the drawing information of Favre. We, however, regard the first lectotype as valid, because its microscopic features agree with Favre's description, and the herbarium G has not rejected it. Kuehner and Romagnesi (1953) and Moser (1978) regarded I. giacomi a synonym of I. boltonii Heim (1931), and Miller (1987) regarded it as a subspecies of I. boltonii from boreal Alaska. Indeed, the spores and cystidia of I. giacomi and Heim's description of I. boltonii greatly resemble each other, although the cystidia of I. boltonii are shorter. More importantly, the pileus of I. boltonii is scaly. That almost certainly indicates a different species. Heim does not seem to have chosen a type, but he mentioned having collected the specimens from a French pine forest; a possible habitat for I. giacomi based on our present knowledge. Unfortunately, we did not manage to get his collections on loan. Jacobsson (2008) gave different spore measurements from ours for I. giacomi (longer and narrower, with Q values 2-2.3). In summary, Inocybe giacomi has a wide ecological amplitude and distribution. It seems to be characterised by a somewhat robust appearance and an inconspicuously umbonate pileus. Our macroscopic description was based on collection ""Vauras 9198F"", which had an exceptional feature of some damaged parts turning brown red. This collection fits well with the photograph ""raccolta 2001"" in Bizio and Rossi (2002). I. giacomi is rather closely related to I. proximella: the ITS sequences of I. giacomi deviated by 22-23 bases and 5 insertions/deletions from the sequence of the I. proximella type.

However, my observations are clearly contrary to those of Alessio, as I found an almost continuous series of cystidial length in different collections of this small-spored taxon. For that reason I. parvispora Alessio has to be placed in the synonymy of I. glabribes. 2) This species is easily recognisable by its very small spores that are on average less than 8.0 microns. Two other small-spored species, viz. I. albomarginate Velen. and I. langei R. Heim differ in having the stipe pruinose throughout and in the lack of a cortina. 3) This species has up to now been called I. microspora J. Lange. However, there can be not much doubt that Ricken (Blaetterpilze : 107. 1915) had described the same species two years earlier. Unfortunately his new species has been completely overlooked.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.

These disagreements, and the status of the species which is admittedly very close to I. calamistrata, will be resolved only by the designation of a lectotype or neotype. In the meantime, we are following a policy we believe should be adopted in such cases : i.e., if no type or authentic material exists, collections should not be identified with the species unless they agree as closely possible with the original description.

Seen separately on different occasions, Inocybe calamistrata and I. hirsuta var. maxima might seem practically identical, but if the two are compared side by side, the striking difference in color (red-brown for I. hirsuta var. maxima, umber of fuscous for I. calamistrata) is immediately evident and provides the clue for distinguishing the two taxa thereatfter.","Grund, D.W.; Stuntz, D.E.

It is regrettable that Favre did not also think so, as he was the first to characterize the fungus, and really should have had the credit for it.

However, extreme variants are always connected through intermediates with the ""typical"" variant, and for that reason no formal taxonomic status could be accorded to var. griseolilacinoides and f. luteophylla. Microscopical characters also show much variation. Some of this variation does not show any definite pattern, but other characters, e.g. breadth of spores show a clinal pattern. Specimens from north-western Europe posses narrower spores than specimens from Central Europe, especially those that grow in the Alps. However, spore dimensions are probably also influenced by metereological conditions, as specimens growing under adverse conditions (especially in artic and alpine habitats) show more variability in this character than specimens growing under more favourable conditions. Therefore even extremes such as I. lacera var. heterosperma do not deserve a formal ranking. 2) The holotype of I. pallescens represents a (semi-)albinistic variant of I. lacera var. lacera, likewise without any formal taxonomic value. 3) The type collection of Inocybe deglubens var. trivalis P. Karst, is heterogeneous, consisting of two different species.

This, in conjunction with his ambiguous description of the odor, has made his species rather difficult to recognize in the field. Actually, in our experience, I. lanatodisca is of widespread occurrence and often abundant locally, but it is usually much darker than "" pale ochraceous brownish "" or "" pale tawny "" (quotes from Kauffman 's description), and its odor is much more characteristic than merely "" nauseous "". The odor is complex, with three main components : green-corn, spermatic, and fragrant (sweet-aromatic). Usually the green-corn component is strongest when the specimen is collected, but fades subsequently, and the fragant component becomes more evident. The white superficial layer on the pileal surface varies considerably in amount from one collection to another, and is frequently absent altogether, giving the pileus a decidedly different appearance from that stressed in the original description.

All other microscopical data are from the Nova Scotian collection DG 1826. The spores of the Nova Scotian specimens are slightly smaller than those of the French material (mostly 8-9 x 5 micron), but in all other particulars the two collections match perfectly. This appears to be the first report of I. maculata from Canada or the United States. In general appearance it somewhat resembles I. lanatodisca Kauffm., but differs markedly from that species in odor and pileal color. The odor of I. maculata has neither the green-corn not the sweet-organic components so characteristic of I. lanatodisca, and the pileus is decidedly umbrinous or chestnut brown, whereas that of I. lanatodisca is tawny or fulvous.","Grund, D.W.; Stuntz, D.E.

Variants lacking these velar patches are for that reason not accorded an autonomous rank. 2) The colour variation exhibited by I. maculata is somewhat greater than Kuehner (in Bull. trimest. Soc. mycol. Fr. 71 : 191. (""1955"") 1956) indicated. Variants with distinct ochraceous tinges are occasionally met, but these cannot be separated from the typical variant. Considering the large variation both in colour and in velar covering it seems not unlikely that some related taxa from the United States, viz. I. fastigiella Atk. and I. lanatodisca C. H. Kauffm., would fall within the range of variation of I. maculata. More material is needed to assess their exact relationships. 3) Inocybe quietiodor M. Bon differs from ochraceous variants of I. maculata in being brighter yelow and in having more regular spores and smaller cheilocystidia. Inocybe flavella P.

Inocybe microspora has definitely smaller spores (6.5-7 micron long), shorter pleurocystidia (rarely exceeding 60 micron), and a longer stipe (usually 30-40 mm long) that becomes flushed with brown in age. Inocybe infelix Pk. (probably in the I. lacera Fr. complex) resembles I. minima, but has quite different spores and cystidia. Inocybe minima is unique because of its small size.

Kauffman. The salient features of the species are the silky-lubricous pileus in various combinations of fulvous and brassy yellow, the medium-sized, prominently nodulose spores, the ventricose pleurocystidia with thick walls, and, above all, the pale yellow, conspicuously flat-marginate bulb of the stipe. By these criteria, there is no doubt that our specimens represent I. trechispora sensu Kauffman, and I. mixtilis sensu Kuehner, and that those two concepts apply to one and the same taxon. Kuehner, while admitting the identity of his fungus with I. trechispora sensu Kauffman and Bresadola, chose, because of differing ""interpretations"" of Berkeley's species, to abandon that specific epithet, and use instead Britzlmayr's name. The matter could have been settled by examining Berkeley's type, but that was not done until relatively recently. Pegler and Young (Pegler, D. N., and Young, T. W. K. 1972. Basidiospore form in the British species of Inocybe. Kew Bull. 26 : 499-538) in studying spores of British Inocybes, examined the long-neglected types of several species, including Agaricus (Inocybe) trechisporous Berk. Their results make it clear that I. trechispora and I. mixtilis sensu Kuehner (possibly no one ever will know what I. mixtilis sensu Britzlmayr really is) are not identical. Inocybe trechispora does not have a marginate bulb and is excluded from the section Martinatae which includes I. mixtilis. There are other less important differences such as slight differences in the spores and paler color of I. trechispora, but the question of the relation of these two taxa now can be considered settled.","Grund, D.W.; Stuntz, D.E.

Inocybe monticola thus far has been found only in montane habitats at intermediate elevations in the western United States. How common or widespread this taxon is remains unknown. It has not been seen fruiting again at the type locale in the 10 y since it was first collected there. For the time being we can say only that it occurs in Oregon and Utah and that it does not appear to be part of the mycoflora that is seen annually. I. monticola material originally was identified as I. splendens var splendens sensu Kuyper (1986) who synonymized I. splendens Heim, I. alluvionis Stangl & Veselsky, and I. terrifera Kuehner. Inocybe monticola fits the concept for I. splendens sensu lato reasonably well, but based on our sequence data it differs phylogenetically from European material representing the species. The European material that we used in our phylogenetic work best fits I. splendens sensu Heim (1931) that is characterized by dark pileus colors and a distinct basal bulb on the stipe. Inocybe monticola differs from Heim's concept of I. splendens by lacking a distinct basal bulb on the stipe. Inocybe alluvionis is characterized by a lighter pileus color than I. monticola and by having a submarginate basal bulb on the stipe that is not present on I. monticola. Inocybe terrifera lacks a basal bulb but can be separated from I. monticola by its lighter pileus colors. Inocybe monticola comes closest to I. phaeoleuca Kuehner in having dark pileus colors and lacking a basal bulb. However its DNA sequences differ sharply from that of the European exemplar of I. phaeoleuca Kuehner and its stature is considerably more robust than that of I. phaeoleuca. In addition a velipellis is present on most of the material of I. monticola and this is usually absent from I. phaeoleuca. One rare European species, I. glabrescens Velen, also has some similarity to I. monticola but differs by having a rimose pileus margin and a more slender stipe that discolors yellowish in age. The material on which I. monticola is based does not belong to either I. splendens sensu Heim or I. phaeoleuca sensu Kuehner, and as mentioned above there are morphological reasons to exclude it from both I. alluvionis and I. terrifera.","Kropp, Bradley R.; Matheny, P.

Its conical scaly pileus, slender, entirely fibrillo-pruinose stipe, and especially the spores with multicoronate warts, make it a very distinctive species. Only two other Inocybes with similar spores have been described, I. lasseri Dennis from Venezuela, and I. petchii Boedijn from Ceylon and Java. These have some features other than the spores in common with I. multicoronata, which thus is the boreal representative of a stirps with world-wide distribution.","Grund, D.W.; Stuntz, D.E.

Collections which show a distinctly purplish red or lilac red apex of stipe generally possess smaller spores and cystidia. However, when more material was studied these microscopical characters were found to show too much overlap to be reliable for a formal subdivision. Specimens with only a faint pinkish or orange tinge at the stipe apex were also encountered, indicating that this character is more gradual too. Both variants do not seem to differ significantly in their ecology, although the variant with the reddish stipe seems to prefer somewhat more natural vegetation, but this character also proved insufficient for a formal subdivision. The macroscopical structure of the pileipellis is dependent on the age of the specimens and the development of the velipellis. These phenotypical differences between strongly squarrose specimens and tomentose specimens are devoid of taxonomical importance. 2) In the collection that I made myself I never noted a smell of bitter almonds. It might therefore be possible that the mention of this smell in several collections is based on biased observations. This might be true for instance in the description by J. Lange (Fl. agar. dan. 3: 78. 1938) where a faint smell of bitter almonds is noted, although the description definitely refers to I. muricellata. 3) Inocybe hirtella Bres. differs in having a conspicuous smell of bitter almonds, being somewhat brighter yellow, and possessing smaller, slenderly clavate cystidia with less bright yellow walls. It never shows such conspicuous reddish tinges at the stipe apex.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.

Lechevalier & Fils, Paris. 429 p.; 133 p.), not without resemblance to I. umbrina Bres., and by its uniformly umbrinous pileus and stipe, differs rather sharply from either I. friesii forma laricina Heim or I. friesii sensu Kuehner (Kuehner, R. 1955.

We think, therefore, that it should not be joined as a variety ti I. friesii, however that species is interpreted. In the 8 collections of I. nemorosa cited, the size of spores varies somewhat from one collection to another. Thus spores of DG 1844 measure 8-10 x 5.5-6 micron and are mostly 9 x 6 micron, while those of DG 1851 are 9-12 x 5-6 micron, mostly 10-11 x 5.5 micron.

The spores of the type of I. brunnescens measue 8-9.5 (-10) x 4-5 (-5.5) micron, mostly 9 x 4.5 micron, and are definitely subreniform : those of the type of I. fastigiella measure 7.5-9.5 x 5-5.5 micron, mostly 8-9 x 5-5.5 micron, and are definitely not subreniform. While there is little difference in size, the difference in shape is evident, as shown in Figs. 6A and 6B. Furthermore, the carpophores of I. fastigiella are smaller than those of I. brunnescens, and with more slender stipes. The diffrence in size of carpophores is in itself of minor significance, but we believe that the two species can be separated by their differently shaped spores.","Grund, D.W.; Stuntz, D.E.

J. Mycol. Lichenol. 1: 164. 1983), who was also the first to synonymise I. friesii with I. nitidiuscula. His conclusion is accepted here. 2) The difference between the yellow-brown variant formely recognised as f. epixantha and the chestnut-brown typical variant is too small and shows too much intergradation to warrant a formal recognition of the former variant as autonomous form. 3) The synonymy of I. tarda with I. nitidiuscula may seem somewhat more surprising. However, a careful comparison between the protologues of both species described by Kuehner (in Bull. Soc. Nat. Oyonnax 9 (Suppl.): 63-68. 1955) makes clear that both taxa are extremely similar in both macroscopical and microscopical respects. Inocybe tarda mainly differs in being somewhat more robust and showing somewhat less pronounced reddish tinges at the apex of the stipe. The material studied by me did not allow for an unambiguous separation of both taxa, as several intermediates were encountered. For that reason these species are considered identical. 4) Inocybe nitidiuscula resembles I. leiocephala Stuntz rather much and can esily be confused with that species, especially when there are scattered somewhat differentiated caulocystidioid hairs in the lower part of the stipe. Inocybe nitidiuscula differs, however, in being somewhat more slender, not possessing a distinctly bulbous stipe, having a cortina in young stages, and having spores with a subconical apex (almost obtuse in I. leiocephala). 5) Inocybe nitidiuscula can also be confused with I. fuscidula Velen., but differs in having a stipe with distinct reddish tinges, larger spores, and pleurocystidia with a somewhat thicker wall. Single specimens, especially in older stages, might not always be separable from I. fuscidula, however.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.

Specimens with a squamulose-subquarrose pileus and a distinct umbo look strikingly different from specimens with a sericeous-smooth pileus without umbo, but both variants are very similar in microscopical characters. This character difference is at least partly phenotypically determined, as both variants are occasionally met in groups that seem to originate from one mycelium. For that reason these variants are not accorded any formal infraspecific status. 2) Inocybe langei R.

The holotype of I. obscuroides (at K) possesses a rather scaly pileus, (slenderly) cylindrical pleurocystidia without lageniform tendency, and spores that have an apical papilla. It is slightly aberrant because of its (almost) colourless paracystidia.

It is characterized by its vernal fruiting habit and its relatively light yellow-brown, slightly greasy pileus that lacks a velipellis and by having a basal bulb on the stipe. Specimens of I. praecox fit within I. splendens senso lato but differ from it phylogenetically. It differs from I. alluvionalis primarily by lacking a velipellis and by lacking the umbrinous pileus that develops in I. alluvionalis. Inocybe splendens sensu Heim (1931) has a darkly pigmented pileus, while I. terrifera lacks a basal bulb on its stipe and has a velipellis. A number of North American species also fit within section Spendentes of Inocybe that could be potentially interpreted as I. praecox. Among these I. bakeri is differentiated by its larger spores while I. kauffmanii has a cream-colored pileus and lacks a basal bulb on the stipe. The single specimen in clade 2 from Washington that is identifiable as I. splendens sensu lato is also at first glance strikingly similar to I. praecox. This fungus fruits in spring in the same region and has a stature and coloration similar to I. praecox. Yet it is phylogenetically distinct from I. praecox and, even though more material is required to fully characterize or formally describe this taxon, a closer examination indicates that some morphological differences exist that allows it to be distinguished from I. praecox. The taxon represented by clade 2 has a distinct velipellis and its pileus becomes rimose toward the margin, while I. praecox lacks both characters. This taxon is probably undescribed, however more collections are required before we can fully characterize or formally describe it. It should be pointed out that the name Inocybe abietis Kuehner originally was applied to some of the material we now refer to as I. praecox in Matheny et al. (2002) and Matheny (2005).","Kropp, Bradley R.; Matheny, P. Brandon,; Nanagyulyan, Siranush G.

I. striata has had much the same status in southern Europe. It appeared conspecific with I. proximella in our examinations, as did I. umbrinodisca. We thus reduce these to synonyms. We have not studied the type of Inocybe striata, but have relied on type descriptions by Bresadola (1927-33) and Bizio and Marchetti (1998), and considered how the Bizio's collections agree with these descriptions. Bizio sent us four recent collections of I. striata that we subjected to ITS analysis. Of these, two Italian and the Croatian specimen agreed in cystidia and reasonably well in spores with the type descriptions of I. striata, as well as with I. proximella. They deviated from the type of I. proximella in their ITS sequences by one or two bases and a gap of three bases (GenBank JN580841, JN580842, JN580843). However, the Croatian and an Italian sequence were identical with some other Finnish sequences of I. proximella. Compared with the type, all the other I. proximella sequences had the same gap of three bases including a collection of Karsten from 1895 (from that collection only the ITS1 succeeded - JN580844). The fourth analysed specimen sent by Bizio from Italy had shorter fusiform cystidia and spores with smaller, irregular nodules, and it diverged greatly in the ITS from the I. proximella type, representing an unknown species. In further support, Bizio and Marchetti (1998) mentioned that the stipe bases of the type fungi of I. striata were ochraceous. This fits our observations of I. proximella. According to Stangl (1976), both Inocybe striata and I. striatorimosa P.D.Orton possibly belong to the I. acuta complex. We have studied a part of the holotype of I. striatorimosa (K). This belongs to the I. soluta Velen. complex, differing from all the species we describe here. The ITS2 sequence of I. umbrinodisca failed, but the ITS1 was identical with most Finnish sequences of I. proximella. Microscopic and macroscopic features and habitat information agreed, except that the odour of I. umbrinodisca was mentioned as fruity acidulous or at times subpelargonious (Kuehner 1988). Kuehner collected I. umbrinodisca under Picea. In conclusion, Inocybe proximella is a rather variable species with a wide distribution. It has typically a rather robust appearance, a weakly fibrillose and rather pale, grey brown cap, often a yellow to ochre tinge at the stipe base, and fairly large spores with rather large nodules. It is likely that it is the most common of all species treated in this paper. However, it is not a common species in Finland. It can be confused with I. silvae-herbaceae, for example. See our comments about I. silvae-herbaceae for comparison. The ITS sequences of the examined one Swedish and 20 Finnish collections of I. proximella, excluding the type, were identical (JV26381 in the phylogram - GenBank JN580845), except for one base difference in collection JV15349 (JN580846), and an insertion/deletion of one base in two specimens (JV21832 - JN580847, KK223/08 - JN580850). An Estonian (JN580848) and a Norwegian (JN580849) specimen both differed by one (different) base from most Finnish specimens. I. proximella is rather closely related to I. giacomi: the ITS sequences of I. giacomi deviated by 22-23 bases and 5 insertions/deletions from the sequence of I. proximella type.","Kokkonen, Katri; Vauras, Jukka.

I. concur with Romagnesi (pers. comm.) who asserted that I. halophila is only a variant of I. pruinosa with somewhat less prominent velipellis. I. studied several collections in his herbarium (e.g. Romagnesi 73.33 & 74.147) which corresponded in all respects to Heim's protologue of I. halophila. 2) Inocybe pruinosa differs from the North American I. bulbosa Peck (in Bull. Torrey bot. Club. 36: 333. 1909) in having somewhat smaller cystidia, larger spores and an (almost) equal stipe. Inocybe longispora M. Lange (in Medd. Groenland 148: 13. 1957) shows some superficial resemblance to I. pruinosa but differs in narrower spores (4.5-5.5 microns broad), less thick-walled pleurocystidia and a stipe that is pruinose over only 1/10th of its length.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.

France : pl. 338. 1789) is identical with the taxon commonly called I. fastigiata. The name I. rimosa, being sanctionned, has priority over I. fastigiata.
2) Inocybe rimosa, as circumscribed here, is an extremely variable taxon. It consists of a number of variants, some of which have fairly constant characters, but some intergradation into other variants can be observed. Some of these variants seem to occupy a rather large area, whereas other such variants may represent nothing more than local ecotypes. It seems likely that some variants (e.g. variants with bright yellow colours, knows as I. holoxantha or I. fastigiata var. cerina) are of a polyphyletic origin. Considering this variability it seems therefore impossible to give a formal well-founded infraspecific taxonomy of this species.
3) Part of the character variability (e.g. pileal form and development of velipellis) seems to be environmentally determined and therefore devoid of any systematic significance. However, another part of this variability seems to be genetically determined, and could in principle be used for a formal subdivision of the species. My observations indicate that some kind of character displacement takes place, and for that reason synpatric populations are generally more different than populations from geographically more distant areas. Therefore to mycologists who are working on a local scale it would seem that many taxa can be recognised; however, the recognition of such taxa on a more regional scale cannot be maintained.
4) An outline of the character variability and the correlation between different characters shows the following picture. The form of the pileus ranges from conical, often with a prominent, obtuse to subacute umbo, to plano-convex or applanate and hardly umbonate. In the latter case a velipellis is usually well-developed, whereas in the former case the velipellis is absent or ephemeral. The degree of development of the velipellis is partly determined by the substrate where the specimens are growing, a rather compact soil leading to a well-developed velipellis. Specimens growing on loose soil (e.g. in Picea-plantations) are typically highly conical. The incrusting pigment of the pileipellis (under the velipellis) becomes more abundant under the influence of exposure. Quite often one encounters young specimens that are rather pale buff all over, growing together with older specimens where the velipellis around the centre of the pileus has disappeared and where the umbo is rather dark brown. Such pale specimens are often referred to I. obsoleta of I. fastigiata f. argentata. Two main types of stipe-covering can be distinguished, viz. a flocculose apex, consisting of clusters of caulocystidia, and a woolly-hairy apex, consisting of catenate hairs with a cheilocystidioid terminal element. The latter type is mostly encountered in specimens that are conical and prominently umbonate. The flocculose apex of stipe is generally found in specimens that occur in parks and other anthropogenic habitats. However, many intermediates between both types of stipe-covering can be encountered. Much attention has been given to the presence of olivaceous tinges in the lamellae as a taxonomic character. Colour of the lamellae is dependant on spore colour, presence of greyish and/or yellowish pigments in the young lamellae and the abundance of yellow-brown refractive hyphae in the hymenophoral trama. Generally speaking it can be stated that the more common these refractive hyphae are, the more distinct is the olivaceous tinge in the lamellae. The yellow pigment can be very conspicuous and such specimens have been described as I. holoxantha or I. fastigiata var. cerina, but this character is too gradual to allow taxonomic separation of these bright yellow variants. It seems likely that the refractive hyphae contain the olfactory substances of I. rimosa as specimens with grey lamellae have a rather indistinct smell, whereas specimens with distinctly olivaceous lamellae have a rather strong smell. The fact that specimens reffered to I. obsoleta are often odourless points in the same direction. In contrast with the wide variability in macroscopical characters stands the relative uniformity in microscopical characters. There is some variation in spore size and form and dimension of cheilocystidia but this variation is uncorrelated with macroscopical differences. Spores dimensions are quite constant but specimens from the Alpine Zone and from the coastal dunes (both associated with Salix div. spp.) possess somewhat longer and more slender spores. Such variants resemble I. arenicola in spore characters but can easily be separated on account of the colour of the pileus, the rather strongly rimose pileipellis, and the distinct smell.
5) Summarising the above picture it seems that four widely distributed variants can be recognised besides a fairly large number of very local variants. Although I wish to emphasise again that these variants do not deserve a formal taxonomic status, they are keyed out as follows:
A. Pileus with well-developed velipellis, whitish when young; lamellae greyish, without olivaceous tinges; smell absent. Variant A (conforming to I. obsoleta). (Intermediates between variants A and C have been described as I. fastigiata f. argentata).
A. Pileus without well-developed velipellis but sometimes with presisting white patch around centre; lamellae usually olivaceous-tinged; small usually present.
B. Pileus usually applanate, dark brown. Variant B (conforming to I. perlata). (Intermediates between variant B and C have been described as I. umbrinella).
B. Pileus usually conical, ochraceous yellow to ochraceous brown.
C. Stipe at apex flocculose, consisting of clusters of caulocystidia. Lamellae ventricose. Usually in parks and along avenues. Variant C (conforming to I. rimosa).
C. Stipe at apex woolly-hairy, consisting of catenate hairs with cheilocystidioid terminal element. Lamellae narrow. Usually in coniferous forest. Variant D (conforming to I. fastigiata). (Intermediates between variant C and D occur not frequently in Northwestern Europe, less often in Central Europe).
6) It seems likely that incipient speciation takes place in I. rimosa but that these variants are not yet sufficiently distinct to be worthy of formal recognition. The occurrence of specimens with intermediate characters probably indicates that genetic exchange betwwen those variants is still possible. Only I. arenicola (R. Heim) M. Bon, I. squamata J. Lange, and I. vinosistipitata Grund & Stuntz are sufficiently distinct in constant characters without intergradation to be worthy of specific rank. Hitherto no intermediates between I. rimosa and these three species have been encountered.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.

Stipe convering can be greatly different between the various collections, depending on the development and differentiation of the intermediate zone. Specimens with a bulbous stipe often possess caulocystidioid hairs almost all over, whereas specimens with an equal stipe can lack them alltogether. As intermediate cases also occur, no taxonomic significance can be attributed to this character, and I. psammophila M. Bon is therefore relegated to synonymy. The bulbous stipe can even seem to be marginate, as the outer side is covered with remnants of the (greasy) velipellis which is completely covered with grains of sand. 3) The development of the velipellis seems at least partly environmentally determined. Specimens growing in damp habitats have a more weakly developed velipellis, which causes a darker colour of the pileus (brown) without a persisting white centre.

However, I. silvae-herbaceae is not as greyish as I. proximella, it has somewhat smaller spores, cheilocystidia with thinner walls, and perhaps the best distinguishing feature is the more variable caulocystidia. ITS sequencing shows that these fungi are not closely related. I. silvae-herbaceae can also be confused with the related I. amicta; see for comparison our comments about I. amicta. Compared with the type sequence, one collection deviated by a base and a gap (JV9200 - GenBank JN580853), three collections by an insertion of a base (KK&JV23073 - JN580854, Kytoevuori 93-146 - JN580855, Heinonen 353-94 - JN580857), and one collection by two gaps (JV4983 - JN580858), when loci with ambiguous bases were ignored.

Inocybe similis differs not only in covering of stipe but also because the pleurocystidia are somewhat larger and less thick-walled, and the spores have an almost obtuse apex. In I. vulpinella the apex of spore is partly subapplanate, suggesting an affinity with goniosporous species as I. decipiens Bres. and I. dunensis P. D. Orton.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.

According to Stangl & Veselsky (in Ceska Mykol. 28: 205. 1974) the name Agaricus sindonius must be considered a nomen dubium. They cited the opinion of Lundell (in Lundell & Nannfeldt, Fungi exs. succ. 47-48: 8. 1956) that A. sindonius could well refer to an unusually pale variant of Psathyrella candolleana (Fr.: Fr.) Maire because of its hollow stipe and subappendiculate cortina. However, both characters can (occasionally) be encountered in the taxon described above. And as this species is very common around Femsjoe, it seems very likely that it must have been described by Fries. As I cannot see any discrepancies between Frie's protologue of A. sindonius (Epicr.: 176. 1838) and the description above, the application of the epithet sindonius is necessary. Unfortunately, it means also the abandonment of the name I. kuehneri Stangl & Veselsky. Frie's wording makes clear that A. sindonius is only apparently superfluous, and the name is therefore not automatically typified with the type of A. pallidus Sow. (Art. 7.9). 2) Reumaux (in Bull. trimest. Soc. mycol. Fr. 100: 177. 1984) has subdivided this species in 7 varieties for which he provided a provisional key. However, none of these characters are sufficiently constant or clear-cut to allow taxonomic splitting, and these varieties are consequently reduced to insignificant variants. It seems that too much attention has been given to subtle differences in colour of stipe and degree of development of caulocystidioid hairs. 3) A collection from the Netherlands (prov. Friesland, Gaasterland, Oude Mirdum) consists of albinistic specimens. 4) Inocybe sindonia usually appears not before the second half of September and is one of the latest-fruiting Inocybes.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.

More material of this variant seems needed for a better evaluation of the relevance of this character state difference. 2) Inocybe splendens var. splendens is rather variable is outward aspect and in colour of the pileus. Specimens with a well-development subvicid velipellis are rather pale and bear conspicuous clods of earth, whereas specimens with a weakly developed, more innate velipellis are much darker (even to dark brown) and have a smooth pileus. The former type is expecially encountered on clayey soils and seems somewhat more xerophytic. This type probably consists of several locally adapted ecotypes. 3) Considering the rather robust specimens as depicted by Furrer-Ziogas (in Schweiz. Z. Pilzk. 43: pl. 1, f. 5-7, 1965) and Stangl (in Z. Pilzk. 37: pl. 7. 1971). I am convinced that their specimens refer to var. splendens, and not to var. phaeoleuca. Furrer-Ziogas (l.c.) also depicted clods of earth which is another indication of his misappliction. His statement that I. terrifera and I. phaeoleuca are extremely close and may probably not deserve specific rank, is correct.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.

The hyphae in the centre of the pileipellis do not or hardly sclerify in these specimens, and for that reason the pileus does not break into apressed scales. This character seems to be only a phenotypic response to moisture. In one collection, viz. Kuyper 1662, both character variants were found. Specimens growing in sheltered conditions were relatively smooth, but specimens growing in exposed situation were distinctly appressedly scaly. No taxonomic status can therefore be accorded to those smooth variants. 2) Inocybe squamata, especialy its variant with a rather smooth pileus, cannot always easily be separated from the extremely variable I. rimosa (Bull.: Fr.) Kumm. The latter species, however, has a more prominent umbo, a more strongly radially rimose pileal covering, a different smell and somewhat larger spores.

For that reason I. whitei has always been considered an autonomous, be it enigmatic species. However, its microscopical characters completely conform to those of collections refered to I. pudica, and for that reason I do not hesitate to synonymise these names.

The collection from Diepenveen has a prominently umbonate pileus, but the specimens are rather robust and the pleurocystidia possess a bright yellow wall. The collection from Kuinderbos consists of small rather slender specimens without an umbo. As both the collections fit the circumscription of f. whitei in 2 characters, and only 1 character is more conforming to f. armeniaca, they are considered here as belonging to the type-form. These collections evidently suggest an occasional mixing of both taxa, and for that reason they can only accorded the rank of form. 4) Inocybe whitei f. whitei has in former times been confused with I. godeyi Gillet, but these taxa can nowadays easily be separated, not only on account of covering of th stipe and presence of a cortina, but also on account of spore-dimensions and spore-form.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.

Inocybe flocculosa (Berk.) Sacc. var. crocifolia (Herink) Kuyp. has a darker, subsquamulose pileus and lageniform cystidia with a (bright) yellow wall. Inocybe auricoma (Batsch) J. Lange differs in the lack of yellow lamellae, and has different cystidia too. In its microscopical characters I. xantholeuca comes rather close to I. fuscidula Velen., but the macroscopical differences are sufficient to allow separation of these taxa on the level of species.","Kuyper, Thomas W. 1986.
